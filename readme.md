## Utopia Online Airline Reservation API
This is a microservice API apart of the utopia airline reservation system. This service handles requests from average users for booking and canceling itineraries.

### Deploying
This service uses Node JS with the "express" dependency for HTTP request handling. The dependency "config" is used for for managing profiles.

See the documentation here for config:

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/config>

This app depends on the config file for the database credentials, so you will have to add your database credentials using config.  
You will need to create a config folder if it does not exist, and add three profiles:

* default.yaml
* development.yaml
* production.yaml

The default.yaml file can be empty, but the other profiles cannot. The structure for the profile is below:

```
---
server:
  port: 8080
  dbConfig:
    host: ""
    user: ""
    password: ""
    database: ""
```

#### Running with a Profile
To run the application, you first have to create an environment variable called NODE_ENV, and set its value equal to the profile name minus the extention.  
So you might run the commands:

```
exportÂ NODE_ENV=production
node my-app.js
```
